# Mandelbrot-Fractal-
Python code to generate a Mandelbrot fractal visualization.
Hi! This is a Mandelbrot fractal diagram drawn with Python. It was a practice project for me, and I plan to add more features in the future â€” for example, using colors more effectively and drawing other types of fractals.
